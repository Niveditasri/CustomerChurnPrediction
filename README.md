# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to proactively retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop and deploy a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn based on historical data.

## Key Components
- **Data Collection:** Describe the source and nature of the data used for training the model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Detail how data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explain any feature selection or creation methods used.
- **Model Selection:** Discuss the machine learning algorithms considered and chosen for the task.
- **Model Training:** Outline how models were trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** If applicable, explain how the model was deployed for real-time predictions.
- **Usage:** Provide instructions on how to use the churn prediction model.

## Directory Structure
- **/data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
